<h1>Framework 13, a Critical 2 Year Review</h1>
<p>TL;DR: Buy it if you have faith in the long-term success of the Framework company and want a laptop that you'll use for 5+ years. Otherwise, stick with more standard offerings on the market.</p>
<p>Around two years ago, I preordered the Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 7040 Series). I remember waiting with glee for its arrival from Taiwan and to experience all the gizmos and gadgets with the full security of knowing that it was modular and easily repairable. Now, after two years of using the Framework as my daily driver, I can summarize my experience as a <em>tumultuous but loving</em> relationship.</p>
<h2>Initial Impressions</h2>
<p>When it first arrived, I had to set up the laptop myself, as I purchased the DIY version. The process was relatively simple, with detailed documentation ensuring that even individuals lacking dexterity like me could follow along with no issues. Half an hour later, I had fully assembled the laptop, and with great anticipation and eagerness, I pressed the power button.</p>
<p>Nothing...</p>
<p>Hmmmmm... odd. I then proceeded by pressing the power button again!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Maybe I attached one of the connections incorrectly?</p>
<p>I remember carefully lifting the laptop to my face to observe it more closely when the dreadful smell of burnt electronics hit my nose. Was I really so incompetent at handling electronics that even with guided instructions and video references, I still ended up somehow breaking the laptop? After opening it up, I discovered the source of the smell was a burnt connection between the motherboard and the keyboard; uploading pictures on the Framework forums confirmed my fear that the keyboard was essentially dead and a new one would need to be ordered (A more thorough analysis revealed that a malfunctioning connector was the issue, not a malfunctioning customer).</p>
<p>I contacted support, and another keyboard module free of charge was ordered and is on the way. This time, the setup went without incident.</p>
<h2>Daily User Experience</h2>
<p>Running the Framework 13 for on average 8 hours per day for two years has made me acutely aware of the machine's strengths and weaknesses. One thing that stands out to me immediately is its poor battery life. For use on campus, it has just enough battery for the day if you remember to charge it fully the previous night. Using this laptop for anything intensive where the fans are spinning in overdrive means you will only have a couple of hours of use before the battery runs out of juice (Better than gaming laptops, which are less laptop and more portable desktop). Furthermore, it runs quite hot. Using it on any sort of blanket or padded surface, and the jet engine will start firing up within a minute. Other than that, using it is quite nice. The touchpad is responsive, the keyboard feels good, and the screen ratio is perfect for productivity-related tasks. I didn't really ever have an issue using the Framework 13 screen visibility outdoors, but then again, I seldom use it outdoors, and it is almost always under some shade. I can pretty confidently say that after 2 years of usage, I will continue to use it as my daily driver for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In terms of bugs, there were two issues I encountered, one catastrophically bad and the other a minor but still undesirable feature. The less severe issue was that the fingerprint sensor simply did not work. I tried looking up solutions on the forum, updating drivers, reinstalling, etc., but the fingerprint sensor simply did not function (note: after updating my BIOS to a newly released version, it fixed itself? Yay :D). The catastrophic issue was that there was an issue with the integrated AMD GPU in the system, where occasionally the entire screen and input would stall and freeze, making the laptop unusable without a restart. I have spent COUNTLESS hours scouring the forums for a solution and trying all types of things, but the issue persists. It unfortunately might just be that my mainboard is just a lemon one that will likely need to be replaced for the issue to be resolved. I probably could've contacted support, and they would've given me a new one free of charge, but the issue only happens every other week, so it's only somewhat annoying.</p>
<h2>Build Quality</h2>
<p>The Framework 13 is definitely on the chunkier side of laptops. It's no MacBook Air (it looks like it ate a couple MacBooks), but it's thinner than the gaming laptop battle stations I sometimes see being hauled around. The build feels nice and solid, which has proven to be not just in appearance, as I've probably accidentally clipped walls or dropped the laptop on the floor a dozen or so times. However, it is beginning to show some damage. For one, the little rubber lining around the screen has begun to fray, likely due to the thermal stress it endures. The touchpad is becoming a bit spotty at times, especially when the laptop is used on a non-flat surface. The keyboard is still responsive, though the right arrow key has died. The charger that comes with the laptop also only charges in specific angles now.</p>
<h2>Why buy it then?</h2>
<p>All I've really done is just tear at the laptop so far. At a price tag of around $1000 (not including the RAM and storage, which I bought separately!), the laptop seems like a horrible choice with the list of problems I've listed above. However, this comparison needs to be done with the perspective of what my experience would've been like using a different laptop for the past two years. Let's say I bought a good, solid HP laptop instead. As an avid laptop enjoyer, the story usually goes something like this: The laptop works well for the first couple of months, then maybe a couple of accidents later, the user experience declines. Maybe the keys get a bit sticky or don't register. Maybe the touchpad spazzes out and doesn't register. The hardware begins to show its age a year or two in, and the fans are now in a permanent state of full-blast whining.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that laptops are going to inevitably deteriorate over time due to usage. Whenever this happens to laptops I've used in the past, there is a sense of dread as I slowly see the laptop become less and less usable over time. It then enters a period where the laptop is screaming to be taken to the back and just put down. For the Framework, however, I feel little to no anxiety when something acts up. Is the touchpad broken? No problem, here's a $30 replacement part that'll be here in a couple of days. Is the keyboard broken? The part is available and can also be shipped. What the Framework offers isn't the most incredible specs or the best value, but a sense of security that I do not find with any other laptop on the market. I don't have to worry about whether I'm going to have to spend another couple of hundred dollars on a new laptop or at the pair shop when I accidentally drop the laptop, since I know that I can easily repair whatever modules are damaged.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the Framework's main selling point is its modularity. Being able to repair and upgrade your laptop so easily is, in my opinion, what sets it above other laptops in the market. You're paying an upfront premium for dividends later in terms of ease of mind and a laptop that will likely be with you until either you die or Framework goes bankrupt. The latter reason is a reasonable concern, but given the large volume of orders for its laptops (I was Batch 6 of like 15 when I ordered my Framework 13!), it's a risk that I'm willing to take. In my opinion, the ideal customer for Framework is a person who is slightly technically inclined or willing to be, and needs a reliable daily driver for more than a couple of years.</p>
